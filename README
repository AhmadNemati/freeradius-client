FreeRADIUS Client is a framework and library for writing RADIUS Clients
which additionally includes radlogin, a flexible RADIUS aware login
replacement, a command line program to send RADIUS accounting records
and a utility to query the status of a (Merit) RADIUS server.

All these programs are based on a library which lets you develop a 
RADIUS-aware application in less than 50 lines of C code.
